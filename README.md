wp-aryo-activity-log-exporter
=============================

Adds the ability to export logs from the [ARYO Activity Log](https://wordpress.org/plugins/aryo-activity-log/) plugin. This is tested against version 2.1.9 but should work with other versions as well.

Once activated, an "Export" menu is added under the Activity Log menu:

The interface is simple:
